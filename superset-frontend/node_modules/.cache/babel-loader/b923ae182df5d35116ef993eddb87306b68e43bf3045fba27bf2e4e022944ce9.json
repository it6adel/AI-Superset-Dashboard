The keys and values stored in this class are individually typed by TYPEMAP parameter.\n *    In the old Registry, all values are of the same type and keys are not enumerated.\n *    Though you can also use indexed or mapped types in a TYPEMAP.\n *\n * 2. This class does not have a separate async get and set methods or use loaders.\n *    Instead, TYPEMAP should specify async values and loaders explicitly when needed.\n *    The value can be anything! A string, a class, a function, an async function... anything!\n *\n * 3. This class does not implement Policies, that is a separate concern to be handled elsewhere.\n *\n *\n * Removing or altering types in a type map could be a potential breaking change, be careful!\n *\n * Listener methods have not been added because there isn't a use case yet.\n */\nclass TypedRegistry {\n\n\n  constructor(initialRecords) {this.name = 'TypedRegistry';this.records = void 0;\n    this.records = initialRecords;\n  }\n  get(key) {\n    // The type construction above means that when you call this function,\n    // you get a really specific type back.\n    return this.records[key];\n  }\n  set(key, value) {\n    this.records[key] = value;\n  }\n}\nexport default TypedRegistry;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
